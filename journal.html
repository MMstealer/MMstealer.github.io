	<h4>This is what I've learned by 10/21/24</h4>
	<li>We have started creating full animations. I now have a project were two shifting sqaures cross. We have started adding Javascript into our code to further advance out knowledge of code.</li>

	<h4>Description of my current projects by 11/4/24</h4>
	<li>Animation is my first projects. It has two moving squares that cross and change shape. I found it cool for a first project because of how three things are going on, moving, color changing, and shape changing.</li>
	<li>Jumpscare is a holloween project that includes a phone call from a mysterious number and when you answer a suprise awaits.</li>
	<h4> What I have learnt by 11/18/24 </h4>
	<li>I have started creating a clock and made it count up infinitly creating a box to hold the number.</li>
	<li>I am currently working to make this clock more like an anolog one by resenting it when it reaches 60 secounds.</li>

	<h4>The Clock is finished/function I know</h4>
	<li>The clock now counts to one minute then all the secounds text boxs go away and a minute one pops up.</li>
	<li>The secounds then reset, and the same thing happens for hours as well.</li>
	<li>Some of the functions I know are:
	Event.listner  console.log  Math.random</li>
	<h4>Using more random stuff</h4>
	<li>We used random and connected it to RGB to make different colors</li>
	<li>We use to have it change colors on reset now it changes based on the x and y cords of the mouse</li>
